# About the PHDMI Team

Our team of mentors at the PHDMI program is comprised of skilled professionals who possess a wealth of experience in the field of public health and health data science. Together, we are committed to converting health data into meaningful evidence for public health decision-making purposes.

Our team's areas of expertise include public health informatics, geospatial analysis, telemedicine, health technology assessment, and infectious disease epidemiology. In addition to that, we promote open data initiatives, FOSS resources, and reproducible research initiatives to facilitate people's understanding of data science. Our team members are also affiliated with the R Epidemics Consortium and the Society for Data Science, international organizations dedicated to enhancing people's data science skills.

Our mentors have undergone advanced training and have participated in several funded data science initiatives and projects. We are passionate about social determinants of health, health policy, implementation studies, health systems research, and health inequity. We are devoted to offering guidance and support to participants in the PHDMI program, empowering them to develop the skills and knowledge required to excel in health data science.

# About SCTIMST

Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), Trivandrum (<https://sctimst.ac.in/>) was established as an Institution of National Importance by an Act of the Indian Parliament (Act No.52 of 1980) with a unique mandate that combined development of biomedical technologies, advanced speciality patient care, higher education, clinical, basic & applied research and public health, under a single institutional framework.

The institute has a university status and consists of the Biomedical Technology Wing (BMT Wing), a tertiary super speciality Hospital Wing and the Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies (AMCHSS).

# About AMCHSS

The Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies (AMCHSS) <https://www.sctimst.ac.in/About%20SCTIMST/Organisation/AMCHSS/> is recognized as a centre of excellence for public health training by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Government of India. AMCHSS is the public health unit of SCTIMST and offers masters level courses in Public Health as well as PhD. It is one of regional resource centres for health technology assessment (<https://htain.icmr.org.in/>) established under the Department of Health Research (DHR), MoHFW, Govt of India. It has also been identified by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) as an Advanced Centre for Clinical Trials.

AMCHSS has been working with the following objectives:

(i) To train highly competent and socially committed public health professionals.
(ii) To advocate for policies that promote equity in health.
