# About PHDMI

::: justify
The PHDMI program is designed to meet the growing demand for professionals with the skills and knowledge to manage the complex challenges of public health in the digital age. With the increasing use of technology and data in healthcare, there is a critical need for public health practitioners who can effectively collect, analyze, and interpret health data, as well as develop and implement data-driven interventions, policies and programs to address public health issues.

The PHDMI program seeks to bridge the skills gap in public health data science and enhance the skills of public health professionals. Our program is a collaboration between the [Indian Public Health Association (IPHA)](https://www.iphaonline.org/) and the [Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology (SCTIMST), Trivandrum](https://sctimst.ac.in).

The program aims of identify, train and provide learning opportunities to ten early and mid-career public health professionals to develop the necessary skills and practical expertise in the applications of data science in public health. The PHDMI program can be an essential pathway for those seeking to advance their careers in public health or pursue doctoral studies in the field.
